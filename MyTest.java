// Since all the functions and pieces of code which were used to build this program consisted
// of some link or the other to the GUI i.e graphical user interface it was not possible for us to do
// the JUnit5 tests like usual. Which is why the code was tested manually by us considering almost all of the
// possibilities for the Connect4 program. Thus, JUnit5 tests were not used in this scenario.
