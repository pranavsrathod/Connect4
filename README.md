# Connect4 ðŸŽ¯

A Java-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game, developed for CS 342. The project features a clean GUI using JavaFX, flexible game logic supporting two players, and test coverage to validate key game states.

---

## ðŸ¤– Overview

This Connect4 project allows two players to place discs in a 7-column, 6-row grid until one player aligns four discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. It demonstrates GUI design in JavaFX, event-driven programming, and modular game-logic architecture.

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **UI Framework:** JavaFX  
- **Architecture:** Separation of UI (views/controllers) and game logic (model)  
- **Testing:** JUnit (or equivalent) in `MyTest.java` to validate game logic  
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## âœ¨ Key Features

- ðŸŽ® Interactive GUI with clickable columns (via `GameButton.java`) and dynamic disc placement  
- ðŸ§  Robust game-logic that checks win conditions in all directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)  
- ðŸ”„ Clean restart and new-game support  
- âœ… Unit tests to ensure game logic correctness and expected outcomes  
- ðŸ§© Modular code structure to facilitate enhancements (e.g., AI opponent, networked play)
